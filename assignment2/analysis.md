# Impact Analysis of Error Handling Changes in Data Pipeline

## Component Addressed 
I analyzed the core data processing pipeline within the Mental Wellness Index (MWI) system, specifically focusing on the changes made to error handling and validation in the following files:
- create_cleaned_mwi.R
- pipeline_driver.R
- crosswalk_func.R
- relationship_func.R
- read_geo_files.R

## Impact Analysis Graphs

### 1. Call Graph 
I created a call graph to analyze the impact of the changes, showing the execution flow and dependencies between functions:

The call graph demonstrates:
1. Entry Point starts at create_cleaned_mwi.R
2. Core Function Changes including new validation and modified error handling
3. Ripple Effects through geographic conversion functions

### 2. Sequence Diagram
To better understand the temporal flow and interactions, I also created a sequence diagram:

The sequence diagram illustrates:
1. Temporal flow of data processing
2. Error handling at each major step
3. Communication between components

## Impact Analysis Insights
You're right. Let me revise the impact analysis section to be more specific to the actual changes and their concrete effects on this codebase.

## Impact Analysis Insights

1. Direct Implementation Impacts:
- The introduction of validate_measure_registry() forces early validation of Metadata.xlsx, which affects census tract and ZCTA data processing. Previously, data validation errors would only be discovered during geographic conversion.
- Changes to perc.rank() to handle NA values impact all score calculations across population and black population indices, particularly affecting areas with missing demographic data.
- The added type validation in get_final_score() specifically impacts edge cases where type='pop' or type='black' was incorrectly specified, preventing silent failures in wellness index calculations.

2. Error Handling Ripple Effects:
- Addition of tryCatch blocks in mwi_pipeline() means geographic conversion functions (county_to_zcta, ct_to_zcta, zip_to_zcta) must now handle and properly propagate errors about missing GEOID values in their crosswalk tables.
- File I/O operations now explicitly handle UTF-8 encoding issues in read.csv operations, affecting how non-ASCII characters in geographic names are processed.
- The error handling in calculate_final_scores cascades to measurement registry processing, requiring all 'Weights', 'Scale', and 'Directionality' columns to be properly validated before score computation.

3. Critical Path Analysis:
- The most critical change impact is in the measure registry validation path: measure registry → mwi_pipeline → geographic conversions. A failure here now stops processing early rather than producing potentially invalid results.
- Secondary impact path is in score calculation: get_final_score → perc.rank, where NA handling changes affect percentile calculations for all geographic regions.
- File loading changes impact the geographic conversion path: read_zips → check_geoid → geographic conversion functions, with new error handling for malformed geographic identifiers.

4. Technical Debt Reduction:
- Removal of TODO comments and implementation of proper error handling in pipeline_driver.R reduces future maintenance burden.
- Addition of validation_measure_registry() centralizes data quality checks that were previously scattered or implicit.
- Standardized error messages and handling patterns across geographic conversion functions make the codebase more maintainable.

These changes significantly improve the robustness of the MWI calculation pipeline, particularly in handling edge cases and data quality issues that were previously undetected until later stages of processing. The impact is most pronounced in the early stages of data validation and geographic conversion, with cascading benefits throughout the score calculation process.
