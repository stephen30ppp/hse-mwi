app_preprocess()

Purpose: Prepares and processes data for the application.
Called by: server function during initialization.

2. plot_map()

Purpose: Generates a Leaflet map visualization.
Called by: Reactive expression within the server function.

3. plot_bee_distr()

Purpose: Creates a bee swarm distribution plot using Plotly.
Called by: Reactive expression within the server function.

4. ui

Purpose: Defines the user interface layout and elements.
Components:
fluidPage(): Creates a fluid page layout.
titlePanel(): Displays the application title.
sidebarLayout(): Structures the main page with a sidebar.
sidebarPanel(): Contains input controls.
mainPanel(): Displays outputs like plots and maps.

5. server

Purpose: Defines server-side logic and reactive expressions.
Components:
reactive({}): Creates reactive expressions for dynamic data.
observeEvent(): Monitors and responds to user inputs.
Render Functions:
renderLeaflet(): Renders the Leaflet map output.
renderPlotly(): Renders the Plotly distribution plot.

6. shinyApp(ui, server)

Purpose: Combines the UI and server components to create the Shiny application.



Eg.
Nodes represent the functions and UI components.
Edges represent calls or dependencies between the functions.
UI components are broken down into fluidPage, titlePanel, sidebarLayout, sidebarPanel, and mainPanel.
The server calls reactive expressions and render functions (renderLeaflet and renderPlotly).
Reactive expressions call plot_map and plot_bee_distr.
