1) The addressed component/module/part of the system:
app.R (Shiny app)

This is the part of the system responsible to boot the application by invoking the 3 main functions which are app_preprocess(), ui(), and server().

app_preprocess():
This function prepares and organizes data which focus on mapping measures to categories, generating lists of available measures groupd by type and weight, processing geographic data for visualizations, and returning processed data for further use in the application.

It has 4 parameters:
m_reg: A mapping between measures and categories.
info_df: DataFrame with additional measure metadata, including weights.
mwi: A list containing mental wellness index data.
app_start (default TRUE): Indicates if this is the first run or part of a custom pipeline.

It will be reused in the server() function as part of a custom pipeline processing, instead of preaparing the data for starting up the application.

ui():
This function renders the html of the web application. It calls sidebarLayout(), titlePanel(), fluidPage() to render different parts of the html to achieve separation of concerns.

server():
This is the core function, which allow the application to render UI dynamically as it manage the states, data and actions for the application.

It will call app_preprocess(), render_starting_modal(), plot_map(), render_UI(), plot_bee_distr() functions.

    render_starting_modal():
    This function will trigger a new render cycle on frontend to render a starting modal to welcome the user, asking them to proceed or need to watch tutorial video.

    plot_map():
    This function will trigger a new render cycle on frontend to render the map on the frontend

    render_UI():
    This function is more generalized. The server uses state stored in variable, pass in this function to render different part of the UI.

    render_table():
    This function will trigger a new render cycle on frontend to render the table for showing the summarized data in form of a table in the frontend.

    plot_bee_distr():
    This function will trigger a new render cycle on frontend to render a bee hive shaped distribution graph on the frontend to show the level of mental wellness in each area.


I have added a new function, check_user_session() to check whether the user is first time opening up the application, 
    if yes, then render_starting_modal() function will continue to render and store a token in the web browser which will automatically expire after 30 minutes.
    If no, then the render_starting_modal() function will not render the starting modal.

2) The graph you created and its completeness:
![Call-graph for app.R](/call-graph/call-graph.jpeg)

3) The impact or insights gained from the analysis:
From the call-graph analysis, I can know that the new feature I have added only impact render_starting_modal() function in the server() function during application startup. It does not prevent the html of the UI from rendering and other UI elements from rendering.

The potentially impacted procedure is the server(), which it might fail to during the execution of render_starting_modal(), if render_starting_modal() successfully finishes, then there will be no other side effects.
